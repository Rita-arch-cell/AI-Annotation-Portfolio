## EVALUATION RUBRIC (10 Criteria)

### CRITERION 1: Identification of Gender Discrimination Elements
**Description:** Model correctly identifies and states all four elements of a prima facie gender discrimination case under the McDonnell Douglas framework.

**Type:** Extraction

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 3 (McDonnell Douglas Framework)

**Justification/Rationale:** 
Source 3 explicitly states: "The employee must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing four elements: (1) The employee was a member of a protected class (e.g., female gender for sex discrimination claims); (2) The employee suffered an adverse employment action (e.g., termination, demotion, failure to promote); (3) The employee was qualified for the position; and (4) Either the employee was replaced by a person outside the protected class, OR the employee was treated differently than similarly situated, non-protected employees engaging in the same or similar conduct."

The model must identify all four elements to demonstrate understanding of the legal framework.

**Dependency:** None

---

### CRITERION 2: Extraction of McGuire's Qualifications
**Description:** Model extracts and accurately lists McGuire's educational and professional qualifications from the case facts.

**Type:** Extraction

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Section I)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 4, Section I states: "• Bachelor's degree in Political Science from Ohio State University (2013); • Graduate of Ohio Police Officer Training Academy (2015); • Hired as probationary Police Officer on June 20, 2016"

This information is critical for establishing whether McGuire meets the "qualified for position" prong of McDonnell Douglas. The model must accurately extract these baseline qualifications.

**Dependency:** None

---

### CRITERION 3: Comparative Analysis of PTO Evaluations
**Description:** Model compares McGuire's PTO performance evaluations to Beach's evaluations using specific pass/fail data from mid-term and final evaluations.

**Type:** Reasoning

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Section IV)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 4, Section IV provides detailed evaluation data:
- **Beach Mid-Term:** "Beach PASSED all 15 evaluation areas"
- **Beach Final:** "Beach PASSED all 15 evaluation areas"
- **McGuire Mid-Term:** "McGuire PASSED 9 of 15 areas" and "McGuire FAILED 6 areas"
- **McGuire Final:** "McGuire PASSED 6 of 15 areas" and "McGuire FAILED 9 areas"

The model must synthesize this data to evaluate whether McGuire and Beach were held to different standards despite being similarly situated trainees. This tests the model's ability to perform comparative reasoning using quantitative data.

**Dependency:** 2 (requires understanding McGuire's qualifications first)

---

### CRITERION 4: Identification of Hampel Four-Part Test
**Description:** Model correctly identifies and states all four elements of the Hampel test for hostile work environment claims.

**Type:** Extraction

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 2 (Hampel Framework)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 2 explicitly provides the framework: "To establish a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment under R.C. 4112.02(A), a plaintiff must prove four elements: 1. The harassment was unwelcome. 2. The harassment was based on sex. 3. The harassing conduct was sufficiently severe or pervasive to affect the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment. 4. Employer liability."

The model must extract all four elements to demonstrate understanding of Ohio's hostile work environment standard.

**Dependency:** None

---

### CRITERION 5: Analysis of "Unwelcome" and "Based on Sex" Elements
**Description:** Model analyzes whether the harassment McGuire experienced was (1) unwelcome and (2) based on sex, citing specific incidents from the case facts.

**Type:** Reasoning

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 2 (Hampel Framework), Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Section III)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 2 defines these elements: "The plaintiff must demonstrate that the conduct was uninvited and undesired" (unwelcome) and "The harassing conduct must occur because of the plaintiff's gender" (based on sex).

Source 4, Section III documents multiple incidents:
- "Palmesano repeatedly called McGuire a 'pork chop' (slang for younger woman dating older man)"
- "Smith attempted to kiss her"
- "Slee stated: 'we had to get her out of there before they got her on top of the bar and started dancing'"
- "Bline, Arndt, and Fleming made comments that 'McGuire would be better off being a stripper'"

The model must apply the legal definitions to these specific facts to demonstrate reasoning ability. The gendered nature of comments (stripper, dancing, "pork chop") supports the "based on sex" analysis.

**Dependency:** 4 (requires knowing Hampel framework first)

---

### CRITERION 6: Frequency Calculation of Harassment
**Description:** Model calculates or identifies the frequency/pattern of harassing comments, particularly the "pork chop" comments by PTO Fleming.

**Type:** Reasoning (Quantitative)

**Weight:** Not Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Section III.B)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 4 states: "Fleming himself called McGuire 'pork chop' once or twice per week throughout her training"

McGuire's training lasted approximately 20 weeks (June 20 - November 14, 2016). The model should calculate or estimate: 1-2 times/week × ~20 weeks = approximately 20-40 instances of this specific harassment by her direct supervisor.

This demonstrates the model's ability to perform mathematical reasoning and understand how frequency contributes to "severe or pervasive" analysis under Hampel.

**Dependency:** None

---

### CRITERION 7: Supervisor Status Analysis
**Description:** Model evaluates whether Officer Tim Fleming qualifies as a "supervisor" for purposes of establishing employer liability under Hampel's fourth element.

**Type:** Reasoning

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 2 (Hampel Framework), Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Sections II & III)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 2 requires showing "either: (a) the harassment was committed by a supervisor, OR (b) the employer...knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action."

Source 4 establishes Fleming's role:
- Fleming was McGuire's "PTO Officer" (Police Training Officer) 
- Fleming "oversaw a portion of McGuire's training and made recommendations for her future in the program"
- Fleming's "November 10, 2016 summary to Captain Riley" directly influenced McGuire's termination
- Fleming stated McGuire "could not be trusted to be on her own"

The model must reason that Fleming's authority to evaluate, recommend continuation/termination, and influence employment decisions makes him a supervisor with power over McGuire's "terms and conditions" of employment.

**Dependency:** 5 (requires knowing Fleming committed harassment first)

---

### CRITERION 8: Severe or Pervasive Totality Analysis
**Description:** Model applies the "severe or pervasive" standard by considering the totality of circumstances, including frequency, severity, and cumulative effect of all harassment incidents.

**Type:** Reasoning

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 2 (Hampel Framework - Totality of Circumstances), Source 4 (McGuire Case Facts, Section III - all subsections)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 2 requires analysis of: "(1) the frequency and severity of the conduct; (2) whether the conduct is physically threatening or humiliating as opposed to merely an offensive utterance; (3) whether the conduct unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance; and (4) whether psychological harm results."

Source 2 also states: "Even where individual instances of sexual harassment do not on their own create a hostile environment, the accumulated effect of such incidents may result in a violation...each successive episode has its predecessors, that the impact of the separate incidents may accumulate."

Source 4 provides multiple incidents spanning June-November 2016:
- Attempted kiss (physical)
- Repeated "pork chop" comments (1-2x/week for 20 weeks)
- "Stripper" comments by multiple officers including supervisors
- "Dancing on bar" comment
- Crude sexual comment ("fucking McGuire")
- Differential treatment based on gender ("harder on her because she was a female of smaller stature")

The model must synthesize ALL incidents and apply the totality factors to reason whether the cumulative effect created an objectively hostile environment. This is the most complex reasoning task in the rubric.

**Dependency:** 5, 6 (requires prior harassment analysis)

---

### CRITERION 9: Citation of Exact Statutory Language
**Description:** Model quotes or closely paraphrases the exact statutory prohibition from Ohio R.C. 4112.02(A) regarding sex discrimination.

**Type:** Extraction

**Weight:** Primary Objective

**Source(s):** Source 1 (Ohio RC 4112.02)

**Justification/Rationale:**
Source 1 provides the statutory text: "It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, military status, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person, to discharge without just cause, to refuse to hire, or otherwise to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment."

The model must cite this language (particularly the "because of...sex" portion) to ground the legal analysis in the actual statute McGuire's claims are based on.

**Dependency:** None

---

### CRITERION 10: IRAC Format Structure
**Description:** Model structures the analysis using IRAC format (Issue, Rule, Application, Conclusion) with clear section headings for each legal claim.

**Type:** Style

**Weight:** Not Primary Objective

**Source(s):** All sources

**Justification/Rationale:**
Legal memoranda follow IRAC structure:
- **Issue:** What legal question is being analyzed? (e.g., "Does McGuire have a viable gender discrimination claim?")
- **Rule:** What is the legal standard? (McDonnell Douglas framework from Source 3)
- **Application:** How do the facts apply to the rule? (McGuire's facts from Source 4)
- **Conclusion:** What is the answer to the issue?

The model should demonstrate professional legal writing conventions by organizing the response with clear headings like "Part I: Gender Discrimination Analysis" and following IRAC within each section. This tests the model's ability to meet style/format requirements specified in the prompt.

**Dependency:** None (style requirement applies to overall structure)

## NOTES FOR EVALUATORS

1. **Criterion 3 & 8** are the most complex, requiring synthesis across multiple data points
2. **Criterion 6** demonstrates quantitative reasoning ability (calculating frequency over time period)
3. **Criterion 7** tests legal reasoning about supervisor status (not explicitly stated, must be inferred)
4. This rubric intentionally focuses on **discrimination + hostile environment** claims, NOT the retaliation claim (which could be added for a 13-15 criterion rubric)
5. All criteria reference specific source locations, making verification straightforward for human raters
